        <h1>Privacy Policy for <i>Nirdesh</i> (নির্দেশ)</h1>

        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [11/11/2025]</p>

        <p>Thank you for using Nirdesh ("the App"). This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled when you use our mobile application. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.</p>

        <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p>We have designed Nirdesh to minimize the collection of personal data. The information we collect is limited and used solely to provide and improve the App's functionality.</p>

        <h3>Non-Personal Information</h3>
        <p>When you use the App, it communicates with our servers to perform certain functions. During this process, we may automatically collect certain non-personal information, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Network Request Data:</strong> To provide "Live Content Updates" and check for new app versions, the App makes requests to our repository. These requests may log standard data such as your device's IP address, device type, operating system version, and the time and date of your request. This data is used for analytical purposes and to ensure the proper functioning of our services.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous data about your interactions with the App, such as which features are used, to help us improve the user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Locally Stored Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bookmarks:</strong> The App allows you to bookmark paragraphs by double-tapping them. This bookmark data is stored <strong>only on your local device</strong>. We do not have access to, collect, or transmit your bookmarks. You have full control over this data and can remove it by un-bookmarking the content or by clearing the App's data through your device settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <p>The information we collect is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> To fetch the latest content for the "Nirdesh" book and ensure you have the most up-to-date version.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve the App:</strong> To understand how users interact with the App, allowing us to enhance features, fix bugs, and improve the overall experience.</li>
            <li><strong>To Notify You of Updates:</strong> To check for new versions of the App on the Play Store and notify you when an update is available.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>

        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties.</p>

        <p>The App is distributed through the Google Play Store, which is governed by its own privacy policy. We may use third-party services (like analytics or crash reporting tools) to help us improve the App. These third parties are prohibited from using your information for any other purpose.</p>

        <p><em>[Please list any third-party services you use, e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase, and link to their privacy policies here.]</em></p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>

        <p>We are committed to protecting your information. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of the data we handle. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>Our App is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information from our servers immediately.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.</p>
